# HEIC to PNG Converter

#### If you had taken some pictures in your IPhone and you need it to be PNG instead of HEIC to do some edit on it, 
##And Also you don't trust Converter Websites Like me:
#### Use HEIC_to_PNG.py file and do it yourself locally on your own computer.

#### You need install _pillow_ and _pyheif_ packages before running it, to do so:
`pip install pillow` 

`pip install pyheif`

## **Good Luck**
